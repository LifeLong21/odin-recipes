        <body>
            Nothing beats waking up in the morn' and thinking, "boy, I'm very hungry." And then you head downstairs and suddenly, <em>there they are</em>. A classic breakfast goodie covered in syrup and berries, and the smell...oh, wow, the <strong>smell</strong>. Aint' nothiing like a good ol' stack of pancakes.

            <p>
                Everyone wants to know how to makes this classic breakfast. Unfortunately, the best we can hope for is...ugh, <em>boxed powder</em>. No, thank you. I'd rather make my own using my favorite recipe below.

                <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>1 cup of milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 beaten egg</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, oil and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately <strong>1/4 cup</strong> for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                <li><em>Serve hot and enjoy!</em></li>
            </ol>
